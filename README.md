# TrueNordsBlockDisplayBuilds
Here are the command block commands if you guys want to spawn and use my Cyberpunk Car for your own builds :) 

Instructions: (This only works in minecraft 1.20+) put the first command into the command block, press the button and spawn the first half of the car, then put the second command into the same command block then press the button to spawn the second half. Then destroy the command block and you should have correctly spawned the car.
